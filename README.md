# Medicinal-Herbs-Identification-using-Deep-Learning
My project, “AI-Based Medicinal Herbs Identification using Deep Learning”, uses the Xception architecture to exploit recent deep-learning advances for highly accurate and efficient classification. Trained on the VNPlant-200 dataset (20,000 images, 200 species), the model achieved 93.34% training accuracy and 96.79% validation accuracy.
